Anveshan 2024 – Case
Challenge: Keanu®, a revolutionary hair regrowth serum formulated with plant stem cells, nano keratin, and
collagen, faces the critical challenge of maximizing market penetration and brand expansion. Despite its
proven efficacy and enthusiastic endorsements from dermatologists and plastic surgeons, Keanu® needs to
navigate a competitive landscape with limited financial resources.

Your Mission: As a team of innovative minds, you must develop a comprehensive and cost-effective strategy
to propel Keanu® to the forefront of hair regrowth solutions.
 Consider the following objectives:

• B2C Expansion : Craft a impactful B2C Expansion Strategy that maximizes reach and engagement
within tight financial constraints. Explore non-traditional channels, and leverage organic growth tactics
to build a loyal customer base.

adoption among dermatologists and plastic surgeons. This could involve educational
workshops, exclusive trial offers, scientific data dissemination, and strategic partnerships with
professional organizations.

• Unveiling Market Potential: Identify untapped markets and distribution channels where Keanu® can
flourish. Consider international expansion, niche customer segments, and unconventional partnerships
to broaden your reach.

• Unleashing Unconventional Strategies: Think outside the box! Propose disruptive tactics that
challenge the status quo and amplify Keanu®'s brand voice. Could augmented reality
consultations, gamified hair journey tracking, or social media challenges unlock new levels of
engagement?

Embrace the Opportunity: This case competition is your chance to showcase your strategic thinking, creativity,
and understanding of the medical aesthetics market. Develop a bold, data-driven, and actionable plan that
positions Keanu® as the ultimate solution for hair regrowth, all while working within budget limitations.
